# Padding schemes for the RSA and its Security

Add project description and information here.

## Milestone Roadmap
### Milestone 1 (01/10/2022 - 02/04/2022):
    - Review literature on the RSA and Padding Schemes.
        - Review the RSA algorithm
        - Review parameter selection methods for the RSA
        - Review Padding schemes for the RSA

    - Implement RSA and its parameter selection algorithm.

### Milestone 2 (02/07/2022 - 03/04/2022):
    - Study malleability of RSA
        - Review literature on vulnerabilites of the RSA
        - Review literature on attacks performed on the RSA

    - Review literature for Probabilistic versions of RSA
        - Review more literature on Padding Schemes for RSA.
        - Review how probabilistic versions of RSA help mitigate/prevent attacks.
        - Review literature on current research for Padding Schemes of RSA.
    
    - Implement Padding schemes for RSA
        - Implement RSA using PKCS #1 v1.5.
        - Implement RSA with Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).
        - Implement RSA with other* Padding schemes chosen for analysis.

### Milestone 3 (03/07/2022 - 04/22/2022):
    - Perform experiments on the following to analyze security and performance:-
        - RSA without Padding schemes.
        - RSA implemented using PKCS #1 v1.5.
        - RSA implemented using OAEP.
        - RSA implemented using other* padding schemes
    
    - Report findings for the following:-
        - Security for RSA implemented with/without Padding schemes
        - Computational cost for each implementation of RSA

**Note:** other* padding schemes for RSA will be selected as part of research performed in Milestone 2. The plan for the project will be updated accordingly.
